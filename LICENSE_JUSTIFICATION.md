# License Justification

We have chosen the MIT License for our Yahtzee game project. The MIT License is one of the most permissive and widely-used open-source licenses, and it aligns well with our goals for the project. 

The key reasons for our choice are:

1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: The MIT License is straightforward and easy to understand, both for developers and users. It clearly outlines the permissions granted, making it easy for others to use, modify, and distribute our game.

2. **Permissiveness**: The MIT License allows for almost unrestricted use of our software, which encourages a wide range of applications and adaptations. This is crucial for a game like Yahtzee, where we want to maximize its reach and allow others to build upon it.

3. **Wide Adoption**: As a well-known and widely adopted license, the MIT License provides familiarity and trust within the open-source community. Developers and organizations are more likely to contribute to or adopt our project if it uses a license they are comfortable with.

4. **Minimal Restrictions**: By imposing minimal restrictions, the MIT License supports the free and open exchange of ideas. This is essential for fostering innovation and collaboration within the community around our Yahtzee game.

In summary, the MIT License is an excellent fit for our Yahtzee game project because it provides the necessary freedom and flexibility for users and contributors, while also being easy to understand and widely respected. We believe this license will help us build a strong and vibrant community around our project.
